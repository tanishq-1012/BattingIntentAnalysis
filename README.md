# 🏏 Batting Intent Analysis – IPL Match

This project explores **batting intent** in a single IPL match (ID: `1473461`) by analyzing player and team-level performance across different phases of the game. Using **Python**, **pandas**, and **Plotly**, we visualize how batters approach different game situations based on strike rate, boundary percentage, dot ball percentage, and other key metrics.
In modern T20 cricket, especially in high-stakes tournaments like the IPL, understanding a batter’s intent is as important as analyzing their strike rate or total runs. Batting intent reflects how aggressively a player approaches different phases of the game.

# Batting Intent Analysis in IPL 2025: Overview

We’ll be using ball-by-ball data from a recent IPL match between RCB and DC, which includes details like over number, batter, bowler, runs scored, and wicket events. This rich, granular dataset allows us to analyze batting patterns across different phases of the game.

The scope of our analysis is to understand batting intent: how players approach the game in various situations; by examining strike rates, boundary percentages, dot ball rates, and over-wise performance, ultimately uncovering insights that can influence real-time strategy and decision-making.
