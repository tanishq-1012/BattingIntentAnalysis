# 🏏 Batting Intent Analysis – IPL Match

This project explores **batting intent** in a single IPL match (ID: `1473461`) by analyzing player and team-level performance across different phases of the game. Using **Python**, **pandas**, and **Plotly**, we visualize how batters approach different game situations based on strike rate, boundary percentage, dot ball percentage, and other key metrics.
